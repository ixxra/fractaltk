# Fractaltk

This is a collection of scripts to generate fractals in javascript.

Joint collaboration between scholars in [Universidad Aut칩noma de Yucat치n](http://www.matematicas.uady.mx) and [Universidad Ju치rez Aut칩noma de Tabasco](http://www.ujat.mx/dacb)

**Important** We are starting this project. If interested, feel free to join us, by sending pull requests. 

Help much appreciated.

# What we aim

* To have a solid library of numerical routines to generate fractals fast.
* To have a nice user interface to explore dynamical systems properties.
* To have fun writing beautiful software (Forget the desktop, welcome to the browser ;-)
